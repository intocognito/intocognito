- 👋 Hi, I’m @intocognito.
- 🤫 I’m using GitHub as my personal blog.
- 😔 It will be depressing, and at times triggering, so you've been warned.
- 🧠 Things get personal here, so this acount is annonymous. 
- 👁  If I gave you a link here, I trust you. If you found this by chance and you know me, you can talk to me IRL.

There's Writing and there's Blog. I may add Art in the fututre.
Remember, it's git, everything lasts forever.
